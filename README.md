[Overview + objectives]

[Data Source section]
---------------------
We use the NEU Metal Surface Defects image dataset, organised into train, valid, and test directories. Each directory contains six defect categories: Crazing, Inclusion, Patches, Pitted, Rolled, and Scratches. The dataset is balanced across classes, with 276 training images per class (total 1,656 training images). The validation and test sets each contain 12 images per class (total 72 images for validation and 72 images for test). Overall, the dataset contains 1,800 images and is suitable for training and evaluating a 6-class steel surface defect classifier.
